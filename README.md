# Match the Hatch

# Instructions and Rules

## How the game works

Match the Hatch consists out of numerous tiles/cards that are masked.
The user needs to click on any card to begin the game. Once the user has
clicked on a <i>card</i> it will "flip" over and reveal it's <i>image.</i> The user then needs to click on another <i>card</i> that
<i>matches</i> the first clicked card's image to win. Depending on what
difficulty is selected the user has a <i>limited amount</i> of
chances/clicks to fin the matching card. The user has the choice to
restart the game by clicking on the "reset" button.
